<!-- ## Conceptualizing Your Domain: Laying the Foundation
![domain name in the search bar](/images/get_website2.jpg) -->

A Domain Name is simply an internet address. If you plan to visit the White House in the USA, you would travel to '1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500, USA'. In the same way, if you want to visit Google, you would journey to the internet address 'www.google.com'.
Just as physical locations on Earth have addresses (like your house, school, workplace), virtual locations on the internet also have addresses.<br>If you own a website, your Domain Name is the link where your website lives.

## Technical perspective
{: .left_header}

The internet is made up of computers and it is common knowledge that computers possess their own language and methods of speaking to one another.
When you type a Domain Name into your browser, it is translated from 'human language' into 'computer language' to what is known as an **IP Address**.
An IP Address is a string of numbers that represents the real address of the website or internet location you are visiting. For example, when you type "142.251.214.142" into your web browser it will take you to "www.google.com".

Of course, you understand why Domain Names were invented because you can just imagine the pain if you had to type "142.251.214.142" everytime you wanted to Google something. Domain Names are a great invention because they allow us to surf the web by using easy to remember, human readable text instead of a string of numbers.

The system that makes it possible for you to type 'www.jaskin.tech' and get directed to the proper location is known as **DNS**, or **Domain Name System**. The DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names into their IP Address. It acts as the internet's address book. For example, when you type "www.jaskin.tech" into your internet browser, your device sends a message to the DNS asking for the IP Adress of "www.jaskin.tech", the DNS then gives your device the IP Address and then your device 'travels' to that location. The conversation may go something like this:

**You**: *\*Types 'www.google.com' into your web browser\**<br>
**Your Device**: *\*Can't understand the meaning of 'www.google.com'. So goes to the DNS and says\**<br>
**Your Device**: Hi DNS, can you please tell me the meaning of 'www.google.com'.<br>
**DNS**: Sure, it means '142.251.214.142'.<br>
**Your Device**: Thank you.<br>

Your Device then goes to the IP Address and you can then google whatever you want. Of course, this whole process takes miliseconds to complete and is a little more complex than the above.


## Parts of a Domain Name
{: .left_header}

![Parts of a domain name](/images/parts-of-domain-name.jpg)

A domain name is seperated by dots. Each section of the name is an identifier in increasing levels of specificity from right to left. Starting From the right we have.

* Top Level Domain
* Second Level Domain
* Sub Domain 
* Multi Level Subdomain
{: .average_ul_bold}

### Top Level Domain:

A Top Level Domain is the general extention. It comes next to the website's name. There are alot of Top Level Domains out there but '.com' is the most popular with over 47% of websites using it.

Some Top Level Domain examples are .net, .org, .tech, .store, .info, .io, .online etc.

Using popular domain extensions can give your website credibility but the downside is they can be expensive and in some cases already taken or bought by another person.

#### ccTLD: Country-Code Top Level Domain
{: .left_header}

These are domains that are specific to a country. They are based on international country codes. Some examples are: 

* **.gh** - Ghana : www.jaskin.gh
* **.ng** - Nigeria : www.jaskin.ng
* **.de** - Germany : www.jaskin.de
* **.us** - USA : www.jaskin.usa
* **.es** - Spain: www.jaskin.es
* etc
{: .average_ul}

A ccTLD is used to localize an organizations offerings or business to a specific country. 

#### gTLD: Generic Top-Level Domain
{: .left_header}

These are Top Level domains that are associated with a specific community or organizations. There are set rules as to which organizations can use them. Some examples are

* **.edu** - This is managed by the EDUCAUSE, and is reserved for US higher education institutions
* **.asia** - This is managed by the DotAsia Organisation Ltd, and is reserved for entities, businesses and organizations operating in the Asia-Pacific region
* **.gov** - This is managed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and is reserved for governmental organizations.
* etc
{: .average_ul}


### Second Level Domain:
The Second Level Domain is what we mostly think of when we think of a website address.

A Second Level Domain is to the left of the Top Level Domain. For example in 'www.google.com', the **.com** is the Top Level Domain and **.google** is the Second Level Domain. Unlike the Top Level Domain, you have free liberty to name the Second Level Domain whatever you like. This is where your brand name goes and you have complete ownership over this address.

To get your Second Level Domain, you would have to buy and register it. [You can read this blog on how to buy a Domain Name](/blogs/buying-a-domain-name){:target="_blank"}

### Sub Domain
You do not need to register a Sub Domain. It is an extension of your domain and can be used to represent another part of your website. A website can have numerous Sub Domains. For example 'blogs.jaskin.tech', 'shop.jaskin.tech', 'school.jaskin.tech', 'party.jaskin.tech', 'lalalala.jaskin.tech' etc, can all be Sub Domains of 'jaskin.tech'.
