            <p>
               A custom-designed website gives you a blog that is uniquely yours. Unlike 
               blogging platforms, custom designs are <strong>made just for you</strong>, with
               features and functions you need, not generic templates 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some reasons you might choose a custom-design are: 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Ownership:</strong> With a custom design you own all the content and data
                of your site. This means you can control how it is used and monetized and you can switch hostiong
                providers easily. On free platforms, you may not have full ownership of your content and data.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Stand Out:</strong> Look different and memorable. You can easily create whatever image you want,
                from a fun to Professional personality.

                <strong>Grow as You Do:</strong> When we build your site, it's built with growth in mind.
                This allows you to start small and dream big.

                <strong>Be Found:</strong> With a custom design, you have greater control over your SEO strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Monetization:</strong> You have more options for monetizing your content. You can sell your own products,
                use advertising, or implement other monetization strategies. On free platforms, you may have to share your earnings with
                the platform.
